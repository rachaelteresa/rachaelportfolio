		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Foundation & Repository Setup",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Project Foundation & Repository Setup' into 4 subtasks. The subtasks should cover: 1. Initializing the Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and the App Router. 2. Installing and configuring Tailwind CSS. 3. Creating the GitHub repository and pushing the initial code. 4. Configuring the project for static export (`output: 'export'`) in `next.config.js` in preparation for GitHub Pages deployment.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves several distinct, sequential steps that are well-documented and largely automated by CLIs. The complexity is low as it requires following standard procedures rather than novel problem-solving."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define Data Models and JSON Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Define Data Models and JSON Structure' into 5 subtasks. Each subtask should focus on a specific data model: 1. Define the main `Portfolio` and `PersonalInfo` interfaces. 2. Define the `Experience` interface and create a placeholder `experience.json`. 3. Define the `Project` interface and create a placeholder `projects.json`. 4. Define the `Skill` interface (with categories) and create a placeholder `skills.json`. 5. Create a `data/index.ts` file to import and export all data structures for easy access.",
			"reasoning": "The task's complexity lies in the careful design of the data structures, not the implementation which is straightforward TypeScript. Breaking it down by each major data entity (e.g., Experience, Project, Skill) makes the task more manageable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Layout and Navigation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Core Layout and Navigation' into 5 subtasks. The subtasks should be: 1. Install and configure `shadcn/ui`. 2. Create the root `layout.tsx` file to define the global page structure. 3. Develop a responsive `Header` component with navigation links using `shadcn/ui` components. 4. Develop a simple `Footer` component with social links. 5. Implement and test responsive breakpoints for the header, navigation, and overall layout across mobile, tablet, and desktop views.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines Next.js App Router conventions, third-party UI library integration, and the cross-cutting concern of responsive design. Separating the setup from the implementation of each layout component creates a clear workflow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop and Populate Core Professional Sections",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Develop and Populate Core Professional Sections' into 5 subtasks, one for each major content section. The subtasks should be: 1. Create the `Hero` section component. 2. Create the `About` section component. 3. Create the `Skills` section component, likely with categorized skill listings. 4. Create the `Experience` section component, displaying job history in a timeline format. 5. Create the `Projects` section component, using a card-based layout to showcase projects.",
			"reasoning": "This is a large task that is naturally divisible by the distinct sections of the portfolio. Each section is a self-contained component that involves data mapping and presentation, making it an ideal candidate for a subtask."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Pink Theme and Styling",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Basic Pink Theme and Styling' into 4 subtasks. The subtasks should cover: 1. Define the pink color palette as custom variables in `tailwind.config.js`. 2. Apply base styles to global elements like the body background, text colors, and headings in `globals.css`. 3. Style the core layout components: `Header`, `Navigation`, and `Footer`. 4. Apply theme styles to the content section components (Hero, About, Projects, etc.) to ensure a cohesive look.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is moderate because it touches almost every part of the existing codebase. Breaking it down allows for a systematic approach: first define the theme, then apply it globally, then to layout, and finally to specific content components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Configure CI/CD for Automated Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Configure CI/CD for Automated Deployment' into 4 subtasks. The subtasks should be: 1. Update `next.config.js` to enable static export (`output: 'export'`) and configure the `basePath` and `assetPrefix` if necessary for GitHub Pages. 2. Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file that triggers on push to the `main` branch, checks out code, and installs dependencies. 3. Add steps to the workflow to run the build command (`next build`) and lint/test checks. 4. Add the deployment step using a community action (e.g., `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`) to push the `out` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.",
			"reasoning": "CI/CD setup involves distinct stages: project configuration, workflow creation, deployment logic, and repository settings. Debugging YAML and deployment scripts can be non-trivial. Separating these steps helps isolate potential issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Interactive Animations and Micro-interactions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Integrate Interactive Animations and Micro-interactions' into 4 subtasks. The subtasks should be: 1. Install and configure `framer-motion` in the project. 2. Implement `whileHover` and `whileTap` animations on all interactive elements like buttons, navigation links, and project cards. 3. Create a reusable wrapper component that uses `motion.div` and the `whileInView` prop to apply fade-in-up animations to each major page section. 4. Implement a simple cross-fade page transition effect using `AnimatePresence` in the root layout.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires learning and applying a new library (Framer Motion). Breaking it down by animation type (element-level, section-level, page-level) allows for incremental implementation and easier debugging of performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Add Unicorn-Themed Visual Elements",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Add Unicorn-Themed Visual Elements' into 4 subtasks. The subtasks should be: 1. Research and select a lightweight JavaScript library for a custom cursor trail effect (e.g., `cursor-effects`). 2. Implement and style the chosen cursor trail to feature floating unicorns or sparkles. 3. Design or source a set of custom SVG icons (e.g., for social links, section headers) that fit the unicorn theme. 4. Create a reusable `Icon` component and integrate the custom SVGs throughout the application.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is moderate, primarily due to the custom cursor trail which can be tricky to implement without performance issues. Separating the research, implementation, and asset creation steps provides a clear path forward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Build the Hobby & Arts Showcase Section",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Build the Hobby & Arts Showcase Section' into 3 subtasks. The subtasks should be: 1. Create the `HobbyShowcase` React component, designing a card or gallery layout for displaying each hobby. 2. Implement the logic within the component to import the hobbies data from the JSON file and map over it to render the content. 3. Add the new `HobbyShowcase` component to the main page (`page.tsx`) and add a corresponding link to the `Header` navigation component.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard, self-contained feature development task. The complexity is lower as it reuses patterns established in earlier tasks. The subtasks represent the standard workflow for adding a new section to the site."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Accessibility, Performance, and SEO Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Accessibility, Performance, and SEO Optimization' into 4 subtasks. The subtasks should be: 1. Conduct an accessibility audit using `axe` and browser dev tools. Fix all identified issues, paying special attention to color contrast, ARIA roles, and keyboard navigation. 2. Run a Lighthouse audit. Implement performance optimizations such as code splitting, reducing bundle size, and ensuring animations are performant. 3. Implement SEO basics by adding dynamic page titles and meta descriptions using Next.js metadata API. Add a `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`. 4. Audit all images in the project. Compress them using a tool like Squoosh and convert them to a modern format like WebP. Implement the Next.js `<Image>` component for automatic optimization.",
			"reasoning": "This is a high-complexity task requiring specialized knowledge in three distinct domains (A11y, Perf, SEO). It often involves auditing the entire application and making widespread changes. Breaking it down by discipline is the standard industry approach."
